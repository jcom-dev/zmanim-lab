    <h1>Calculation of Times Published in the Calendar of the Machzikei Hadas Community of Manchester</h1>
    <h2>The Times are for Manchester Only</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>A. Dawn (Alos Hashachar) 1</h3>
        <p>This is when the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon. Since the sun does not descend all [21 May till 21 July], therefore in the world we have printed the time for dawn at midnight.</p>
        
        <p>This calculation is for 4 "mil" before the horizon, meaning according to how the sun descends in the Land of Israel below the horizon 72 minutes before sunrise during the days of Nissan and Tishrei. This time is mentioned in the commentary of the Vilna Gaon and in the Siddur of the Rav. Recently it has begun to be printed in the calendars of Jewish communities in this country as a stringency, to complete nighttime mitzvos before this time such as the evening Shema and counting of the Omer.</p>

        <h3>B. Dawn (Alos Hashachar) 2</h3>
        <p>This is when the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon. This method was mentioned in the responsa of Minchas Yitzchak, Part 9, Section 9, that this corresponds with reality. This has been the practice in many communities in Northern Europe, and this time has been printed for dawn for nearly eighty years since the founding of the community.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p>At the end of the calendar, additional times for dawn are printed, for those whose custom it is:</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-item">
            <p><strong>Dawn 3:</strong> For the calculation of 4 "mil" equal to 72 minutes before sunrise throughout the entire year. Some add in summer to account for the measure of a "mil" being 22.5 minutes, and according to this, dawn is 90 minutes before sunrise.</p>
            
            <p>Those who follow this method should not remove their tefillin and tallis until some time after dawn.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sub-item">
            <p><strong>Dawn 4:</strong> For the calculation of one-eighth of the day, as printed by the Minchas Yitzchak as a stringency.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>C. Misheyakir (Earliest Time for Tallis and Tefillin)</h3>
        <p>Misheyakir is the time for beginning to put on tallis and tefillin with a blessing for Shema. (In pressing circumstances, such as one traveling, one may put on tallis 2 degrees [earlier]. The printed Misheyakir is a quarter hour after the time of Misheyakir).</p>

        <h3>D. Sunrise (Hanetz Hachama)</h3>
        <p>The time when the upper edge of the sun rises above the horizon at sea level.</p>

        <h3>E. Latest Time for Shema - Magen Avraham</h3>
        <p>This is one quarter of the day from Dawn 2 until the time of nightfall printed in the calendar.</p>
        
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>On Sabbaths and at the end of the calendar</strong> two additional times are printed for the latest time for Shema according to the methods of the Magen Avraham:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Latest Shema MA 1</strong> - As printed in several calendars for the calculation from Dawn 1 (meaning 16.1°) until nightfall at 16.1°, so that there should be equal time between the beginning of the day and end of the day. This time is adopted as a stringency for Shema from the Torah.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Latest Shema MA 3</strong> - As practiced in many places for the calculation of 72 minutes before sunrise to 72 minutes after sunset. According to this calculation, the latest time for Shema according to MA is always 36 minutes before the time of the Gra.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>F. Latest Time for Shema - Vilna Gaon and Rabbi Zalman</h3>
        <p>This is one quarter of the day from sunrise until sunset, and is the latest time for reciting Shema.</p>

        <h3>G. Latest Time for Prayer - Magen Avraham</h3>
        <p>This is one third of the day from Dawn 2 until the time of nightfall.</p>
        <p>For those who follow the calculation of dawn being 72 minutes before [sunrise], the latest time for prayer according to MA is always 24 minutes before the latest time for prayer according to the Gra.</p>

        <h3>H. Latest Time for Prayer - Vilna Gaon</h3>
        <p>This is one third of the day from sunrise until sunset.</p>

        <h3>I. Midday (Chatzos)</h3>
        <p>This is the time when the sun stands at the highest point in the sky between east and west. It is half the time between sunrise and sunset. Midnight is clearly 12 hours after midday <span class="citation">(see Igros Moshe, Orach Chaim 2:20)</span> and may vary by one minute.</p>

        <h3>J. Large Mincha Time (Mincha Gedolah)</h3>
        <p>One hour after midday. The practice is to be stringent that it should be half a proportional hour and not less than 30 minutes (in winter when the day is short, half a proportional hour is less than 30 minutes).</p>

        <h3>K. Small Mincha Time (Mincha Ketanah)</h3>
        <p>This is two and a half proportional hours before sunset.</p>

        <h3>L. Plag Hamincha 1 - According to Halacha and the Gra</h3>
        <p>The earliest time for praying Maariv (evening prayer), for lighting Shabbos candles, and lighting Chanukah candles. This is one and a quarter proportional hours before sunset.</p>

        <h3>M. Plag Hamincha 2 - According to Terumas Hadeshen</h3>
        <p>This is one and a quarter proportional hours before nightfall, calculating the day from Dawn 2 until nightfall as printed.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-item">
            <p><strong>Plag Hamincha 3:</strong> At the end of the calendar we have printed Plag according to MA/Terumas Hadeshen practiced in many communities, which is one and a quarter [hours] before nightfall 72 minutes after sunset. Since the time for accepting Shabbos, we have only printed for the community.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>N. Sunset (Shkias Hachama)</h3>
        <p>The time when the sun is completely hidden from our eyes. The time printed is close to complete before the actual time.</p>

        <h3>O. Nightfall (Tzeis Hakochavim)</h3>
        <p>The time for lighting candles and small stars, which is when the sun is 7.08 degrees below the horizon. Regarding rabbinic fasts, one may be lenient by several minutes, and one should consult a halachic authority.</p>

        <h3>P. Time for Lighting Candles and Accepting Shabbos</h3>
        <p>15 minutes before sunset, as has been the custom from ancient times.</p>

        <h3>Q. End of Shabbos (Motzai Shabbos)</h3>
        <p>This is when three small consecutive stars are visible, and this time is when the sun is 8 degrees below the horizon.</p>

        <h3>R. Rabbeinu Tam</h3>
        <p>For the calculation of 72 minutes equally after sunset throughout the entire year, provided that the sun is at least 8 degrees below the horizon.</p>

        <h3>S. Fasts</h3>
        <p>End time for eating in the morning on a minor fast day <span class="citation">(see Orach Chaim 564)</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="general-rule">
        <h3>General Principle</h3>
        <p>Since there are depressions in the horizon in the area, the times may differ in various locations within the city, and also [depending on] weather conditions. It is advisable to be stringent by at least one minute for all times.</p>
