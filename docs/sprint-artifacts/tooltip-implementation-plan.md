# Tooltip Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines a comprehensive tooltip implementation across the Zmanim Lab platform. Tooltips will enhance user experience by providing contextual help for technical terminology, status indicators, form fields, and complex features.

## Current State

- **Tooltip component:** EXISTS at `web/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` (shadcn/ui Radix-based)
- **Global provider:** NOT configured (each usage requires local `TooltipProvider`)
- **Existing usage:** Single implementation in algorithm editor for disabled state explanation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

**1.1 Add Global TooltipProvider**

Add `TooltipProvider` to the root layout so tooltips work consistently across all pages without wrapping each component individually.

- **File:** `web/app/layout.tsx`
- **Change:** Wrap children with `<TooltipProvider delayDuration={300}>`

**1.2 Create Reusable Tooltip Components**

Create helper components for common tooltip patterns to ensure consistency.

- **File:** `web/components/shared/InfoTooltip.tsx` (NEW)
- **Purpose:** Small info icon (?) that reveals tooltip on hover
- **Usage:** Form field labels, table headers, status badges

```tsx
// Example API
<InfoTooltip content="Explanation text here" />
<InfoTooltip content="Longer explanation" side="right" />
```

**1.3 Create Tooltip Content Constants**

Centralize tooltip content for consistency and easy updates.

- **File:** `web/lib/tooltip-content.ts` (NEW)
- **Contents:** Organized by category (status, technical, halachic, actions)

---

### Phase 2: High Priority - Public-Facing Pages

**2.1 Homepage (`web/app/page.tsx`)**

| Element | Tooltip Content |
|---------|----------------|
| "Use My Location" button | "Requires browser location permission. Your location data is only used for finding nearby zmanim and is not stored." |
| City elevation display | "Elevation affects sunrise and sunset times. Higher elevations see the sun earlier in the morning and later in the evening." |
| Coverage level badges | "Publishers can cover entire continents, countries, regions, or specific cities. More specific coverage typically means more localized accuracy." |

**2.2 Zmanim Display Pages**

- **Files:** `web/app/zmanim/[cityId]/page.tsx`, `web/app/zmanim/[cityId]/[publisherId]/page.tsx`

| Element | Tooltip Content |
|---------|----------------|
| Verified badge | "This publisher has been verified by our team. Their identity and halachic authority have been confirmed." |
| Time format | "All times shown in 12-hour format (AM/PM)" |
| Zman category tags | Dynamic based on category (Essential, Optional, Event-based) |

---

### Phase 3: Publisher Pages

**3.1 Publisher Dashboard (`web/app/publisher/dashboard/page.tsx`)**

| Element | Tooltip Content |
|---------|----------------|
| Status: "Verified" | "Your account is fully verified. Your zmanim are visible to users in your coverage areas." |
| Status: "Pending" | "Your account is awaiting admin verification. This typically takes 1-3 business days." |
| Status: "Draft" | "These zmanim are not yet published. Users cannot see draft zmanim." |
| "Calculations this month" | "Number of times users have requested zmanim that included your calculations." |

**3.2 Publisher Profile (`web/app/publisher/profile/page.tsx`)**

| Element | Tooltip Content |

| Status: "Published" | "Visible to users in your coverage areas." |

**3.4 Algorithm Editor (`web/app/publisher/algorithm/edit/[zman_key]/page.tsx`)**

| Element | Tooltip Content |
|---------|----------------|
| "Guided Builder" tab | "Visual formula builder for common calculation patterns. Best for standard calculations." |

| Hebrew name field | "Required. Must contain Hebrew characters (א-ת). Displayed to Hebrew-reading users." |
| Transliteration field | "Phonetic pronunciation for non-Hebrew speakers. Example: 'Alos HaShachar'" |
| AI Explanation button | "Generate a plain-language explanation of this zman using AI. Available in Hebrew or English." |
| Publisher Comment | "Optional note displayed to end users. Use for halachic context or special instructions." |
| Preview section | "Test your formula with different dates and locations to verify calculations." |

**3.5 Coverage Setup (`web/app/publisher/coverage/page.tsx`)**

| Active toggle | "Inactive coverage areas are hidden from users but preserved for later use." |

---

### Phase 4: Admin Pages

**4.1 Admin Dashboard (`web/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`)**

| Element | Tooltip Content |
|---------|----------------|
| "Active Publishers" | "Publishers with verified status whose zmanim are visible to users." |

Add tooltips to each DSL primitive and function explaining syntax and usage.

| Category | Examples with Tooltips |
|----------|----------------------|
| Primitives | `SUNRISE`, `SUNSET`, `ALOS`, `TZEIS` - each with definition |
| Functions | `SolarAngle(degrees, direction)`, `FixedOffset(base, minutes)` |

| Method: Solar Angle | "Time when sun reaches specific angle below horizon" |
| Method: Fixed Offset | "Minutes before or after another zman" |
| Method: Proportional Hours | "Fraction of halachic day based on GRA or MGA" |

**5.3 Bilingual Input (`web/components/shared/BilingualInput.tsx`)**

Convert existing inline help text to tooltips on the field labels for cleaner UI.

### Phase 6: Halachic Terminology Glossary Tooltips

Create a centralized glossary for consistent halachic term tooltips.

**File:** `web/lib/halachic-glossary.ts` (NEW)

```tsx
export const HALACHIC_TERMS = {
  alos_hashachar: "Dawn - the first light visible on the eastern horizon",
  netz_hachama: "Sunrise - when the sun's upper edge appears on the horizon",
  sof_zman_shema: "Latest time to recite the morning Shema prayer",
  sof_zman_tefillah: "Latest time for the morning Amidah prayer",
  chatzos: "Midday - when the sun is at its highest point",
  mincha_gedolah: "Earliest time for afternoon prayer",
  mincha_ketanah: "Preferred start time for afternoon prayer",
  plag_hamincha: "Transitional time between afternoon and evening",
  shkiah: "Sunset - when the sun's upper edge disappears below horizon",
  tzeis_hakochavim: "Nightfall - when three medium stars are visible",
  // ... etc
};
```

---

## Implementation Order

1. **Infrastructure** (Phase 1) - Enables all subsequent work
2. **Publisher Algorithm Editor** (Phase 3.4) - Most complex page, highest user confusion
3. **Publisher Dashboard & Status** (Phase 3.1) - High visibility, common questions
4. **Homepage** (Phase 2.1) - First touchpoint for new users
5. **Coverage Setup** (Phase 3.5) - Complex concept needing explanation
6. **Admin Pages** (Phase 4) - Lower priority, internal users
7. **DSL Components** (Phase 5) - Technical depth for power users

## Success Criteria

- All status badges have tooltips explaining their meaning
- All technical terms (DSL, GRA, MGA, solar angle) have clear explanations
- All form fields with non-obvious purposes have helper tooltips
- Tooltips are consistent in tone and length (1-2 sentences)
- No tooltip blocks interaction with underlying elements
- Tooltips work on both desktop (hover) and mobile (tap)

---

## Estimated Scope

- **New files:** 3
- **Modified files:** ~15
- **Individual tooltips:** ~60-80
- **Complexity:** Medium (mostly additive, low risk)
