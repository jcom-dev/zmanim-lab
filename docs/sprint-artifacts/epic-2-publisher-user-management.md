# Epic 2: Publisher User Management & Dashboard

**Author:** BMad
**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Status:** Draft
**Depends On:** Epic 1 (Zmanim Lab MVP) - COMPLETED

---

## Overview

Epic 2 transforms publisher management from entity-only to full user lifecycle. Admins can invite real users to manage publishers via Clerk, users can manage multiple publishers with a switcher, and admins can impersonate publishers for support. The publisher dashboard becomes a comprehensive hub with coverage management, algorithm status, analytics, and activity logging.

**Core Theme:** "Connect People to Publishers"

## Story 2.1: Publisher User Invitation

**As an** administrator,
**I want** to invite users to manage a publisher account via Clerk,
**So that** real people can access and configure their publisher's settings.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am logged in as an admin
**When** I navigate to /admin/publishers/{id}
**Then** I see a "Users" section with a list of users linked to this publisher

**Given** I am viewing a publisher's users section
**When** I click "Invite User"
**Then** I see a form with email address field

**Given** I enter a valid email and submit
**When** the invitation is created
**Then** Clerk sends an invitation email with redirect to /accept-invitation
**And** the invitation includes publicMetadata: `{ role: 'publisher', publisher_access_list: [publisher_id] }`

**Given** an invited user clicks the invitation link
**When** they complete Clerk signup
**Then** their account is created with the metadata from the invitation
**And** they can access /publisher dashboard

**Given** an existing user is invited to another publisher
**When** they accept the invitation
**Then** the new publisher_id is added to their publisher_access_list
**And** they can switch between publishers

**Given** I am viewing a publisher's users
**When** I click "Remove" on a user
**Then** that publisher_id is removed from their publisher_access_list
**And** if they have no publishers left, their role reverts to 'user'

### Prerequisites

Story 1.3 (Admin Publisher Management)

### Technical Notes

- Use Clerk Admin API: `clerkClient.invitations.createInvitation()`
- Invitation payload:
  ```typescript
  {
    emailAddress: 'user@example.com',
    redirectUrl: 'https://app.zmanim-lab.com/accept-invitation',
    publicMetadata: {
      role: 'publisher',
      publisher_access_list: [publisher_uuid]
    }
  }
  ```
- Create `web/app/accept-invitation/page.tsx` - handles post-signup redirect
- For existing users, use `clerkClient.users.updateUserMetadata()` to append to publisher_access_list
- Create API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/admin/publishers/{id}/users` - list users for publisher
  - `POST /api/admin/publishers/{id}/users/invite` - send invitation
  - `DELETE /api/admin/publishers/{id}/users/{userId}` - remove user from publisher
- Database: No new tables needed - user-publisher linking is in Clerk metadata
- Update `web/app/admin/publishers/[id]/page.tsx` to show users section

## Story 2.2: Multi-Publisher Switcher

**As a** user managing multiple publishers,
**I want** to switch between publishers in the dashboard,
**So that** I can manage each publisher's settings independently.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am logged in with publisher_access_list containing multiple publisher IDs
**When** I navigate to /publisher
**Then** I see a publisher switcher dropdown in the dashboard header

**Given** the publisher switcher is visible
**When** I click on it
**Then** I see a list of all publishers I have access to (name + organization)

**Given** I select a different publisher from the switcher
**When** the selection is applied
**Then** the entire dashboard context switches to that publisher
**And** coverage, algorithm, analytics all reflect the selected publisher

**Given** I am logged in with only one publisher in publisher_access_list
**When** I navigate to /publisher
**Then** the switcher is hidden (or shows as static text)

**Given** I select a publisher
**When** I navigate between dashboard sections
**Then** the selected publisher persists until I switch again

### Prerequisites

Story 2.1 (Publisher User Invitation)

### Technical Notes

- Create `web/components/publisher/PublisherSwitcher.tsx`
- Use shadcn/ui Select or Popover component
- Store selected publisher in:
  - URL param: `/publisher?p={publisher_id}` (allows direct linking)
  - Or localStorage with URL override
- Create React context: `PublisherContext` with `selectedPublisherId`
- Fetch publisher list from Clerk metadata on auth
- API needs to validate user has access to requested publisher_id
- Create `web/hooks/usePublisherContext.ts`

## Story 2.3: Admin Impersonation Mode

**As an** administrator,
**I want** to view and edit any publisher's dashboard as if I were them,
**So that** I can provide support and troubleshoot issues.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am logged in as an admin
**When** I am on /admin/publishers/{id}
**Then** I see an "Impersonate Publisher" button

**Given** I click "Impersonate Publisher"
**When** impersonation mode activates
**Then** I am redirected to /publisher with that publisher selected
**And** a prominent banner shows "Impersonating: {Publisher Name} - Exit"

**Given** I am in impersonation mode
**When** I make changes (coverage, algorithm, profile)
**Then** the changes are saved to that publisher's data
**And** the activity log records "Changed by Admin (impersonating)"

**Given** I am in impersonation mode
**When** I click "Exit" in the impersonation banner
**Then** I am returned to /admin/publishers/{id}
**And** impersonation mode ends

**Given** I am not an admin
**When** I try to access impersonation mode via URL manipulation
**Then** I receive a 403 Forbidden error

### Prerequisites

Story 2.2 (Multi-Publisher Switcher)

### Technical Notes

- Impersonation state stored in session/cookie: `impersonating_publisher_id`
- Create `web/components/admin/ImpersonationBanner.tsx`
- Middleware checks:
  1. If user is admin AND impersonating_publisher_id is set → allow publisher routes
  2. Pass `impersonating: true` flag to API calls
- API endpoints accept optional `X-Impersonating-Publisher` header (admin only)
- Go middleware validates admin role before honoring impersonation header
- Activity log entries include `actor_type: 'admin_impersonation'` when applicable
- Create API endpoint: `POST /api/admin/impersonate/{publisherId}` - sets session
- Create API endpoint: `POST /api/admin/impersonate/exit` - clears session

## Story 2.4: Dynamic Home Navigation

**As a** user,
**I want** to see relevant navigation options on the home page based on my role,
**So that** I can quickly access the areas I need.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am not logged in
**When** I view the home page
**Then** I see the location search and "Sign In" button
**And** no admin or publisher navigation

**Given** I am logged in as a regular user (no publisher_access_list, no admin role)
**When** I view the home page
**Then** I see the location search
**And** no admin or publisher buttons

**Given** I am logged in with publisher_access_list containing at least one publisher
**When** I view the home page
**Then** I see a "Publisher Dashboard" button
**And** clicking it navigates to /publisher

**Given** I am logged in as an admin
**When** I view the home page
**Then** I see an "Admin Portal" button
**And** clicking it navigates to /admin

**Given** I am logged in as an admin with publisher_access_list
**When** I view the home page
**Then** I see both "Admin Portal" and "Publisher Dashboard" buttons

### Prerequisites

Story 2.3 (Admin Impersonation Mode)

### Technical Notes

- Update `web/app/page.tsx` (home page)
- Use Clerk's `useUser()` hook to get publicMetadata
- Extract role and publisher_access_list from metadata
- Create `web/components/home/RoleNavigation.tsx`
- Button styling should be prominent but not overwhelming
- Consider card-based layout for role options
- Admin role check: `publicMetadata.role === 'admin'` OR check Clerk organization membership

## Story 2.5: Enhanced Coverage Management

**As a** publisher,
**I want** to manage my geographic coverage with an intuitive multi-location interface,
**So that** I can precisely define where my zmanim are available.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am on /publisher/coverage
**When** the page loads
**Then** I see my current coverage areas listed with country/region/city breakdown
**And** I see a map visualization of my coverage

**Given** I want to add coverage
**When** I click "Add Coverage"
**Then** I see a hierarchical selector: Country → Region → City

**Given** I select a country (e.g., "United States")
**When** I choose to add at country level
**Then** all cities in that country are included in my coverage

**Given** I select a country and then a region (e.g., "New York")
**When** I choose to add at region level
**Then** all cities in that region are included in my coverage

**Given** I drill down to city level (e.g., "Brooklyn")
**When** I select the city
**Then** only that specific city is added to my coverage

**Given** I have multiple coverage areas
**When** I view the coverage list
**Then** each area shows: level (country/region/city), name, priority, active status

**Given** I want to remove coverage
**When** I click the delete icon on a coverage area
**Then** a confirmation dialog appears
**And** upon confirmation, the coverage is removed

**Given** I have overlapping coverage (e.g., "United States" + "Brooklyn")
**When** a user searches for Brooklyn
**Then** the more specific coverage (Brooklyn) takes priority

**Given** I modify coverage
**When** I save changes
**Then** the map updates to reflect new coverage areas

### Prerequisites

Story 2.4 (Dynamic Home Navigation), builds on Story 1.6

### Technical Notes

- Refactor `web/app/publisher/coverage/page.tsx` for better UX
- Create `web/components/publisher/CoverageManager.tsx` - main component
- Create `web/components/publisher/CoverageHierarchyPicker.tsx` - country/region/city selector
- Create `web/components/publisher/CoverageList.tsx` - list with actions
- Update database schema:
  ```sql
  -- Add coverage_level to track hierarchy
  ALTER TABLE publisher_coverage ADD COLUMN coverage_level TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'city';
  -- coverage_level: 'country', 'region', 'city'

  -- Add geo_reference for non-city levels
  ALTER TABLE publisher_coverage ADD COLUMN geo_reference TEXT;
  -- For country: country code (e.g., 'US')
  -- For region: region identifier (e.g., 'US-NY')
  -- For city: NULL (use city_id)
  ```
- API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/publisher/coverage` - list with hierarchy info
  - `POST /api/publisher/coverage` - add coverage `{ level, geo_id_or_reference, priority }`
  - `PUT /api/publisher/coverage/{id}` - update priority/active
  - `DELETE /api/publisher/coverage/{id}` - remove
- Map component: Use Leaflet or Mapbox GL to highlight covered regions
- When querying publishers for a city, check: exact city match → region match → country match

**When** I navigate to /publisher
**Then** I see a dashboard hub with cards/sections for:
  - Profile (name, org, status)
  - Algorithm (status: draft/published, last updated)
  - Coverage (count of areas, quick stats)
  - Analytics (total calculations this month)
  - Activity Log (recent changes)

**Given** I view the Profile card
**When** I click on it
**Then** I navigate to /publisher/profile

**Given** I view the Algorithm card
**When** the status shows "Draft"
**Then** I see a warning indicator that algorithm is not published

**Then** I see the 5 most recent activities with timestamps

### Prerequisites

Story 2.5 (Enhanced Coverage Management)

### Technical Notes

- Refactor `web/app/publisher/page.tsx` to be the dashboard hub (currently may redirect)
- Create `web/components/publisher/DashboardCard.tsx` - reusable card component
- Create layout: 2x2 grid on desktop, stack on mobile
- Fetch summary data via new API:
  - `GET /api/publisher/dashboard-summary` returns:
    ```json
    {
      "profile": { "name": "...", "is_verified": true },
      "algorithm": { "status": "published", "updated_at": "..." },
      "coverage": { "total_areas": 5, "total_cities": 120 },

**Then** I see:
  - Total calculations (all time)
  - Calculations this month
  - Number of coverage areas
  - Number of cities covered

**Given** calculations have been made
**When** I view the stats
**Then** I see accurate counts based on actual API usage

**Given** I am a new publisher with no calculations
**When** I view analytics
**Then** I see zeros with a friendly "No activity yet" message

**Given** I want more detail
**When** I view the page
**Then** I see a note "Detailed analytics coming soon"

### Prerequisites

    city_id UUID REFERENCES cities(id),
    calculated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    cache_hit BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
  );

  CREATE INDEX idx_calc_logs_publisher ON calculation_logs(publisher_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_calc_logs_date ON calculation_logs(calculated_at);
  ```
- Log calculations in `api/internal/services/zmanim_service.go`
- API endpoint: `GET /api/publisher/analytics`
- Aggregate queries:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM calculation_logs WHERE publisher_id = $1;
