# Story 2.2: Multi-Publisher Switcher

**Epic:** Epic 2 - Publisher User Management & Dashboard
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 3

---

## User Story

**As a** user managing multiple publishers,
**I want** to switch between publishers in the dashboard,
**So that** I can manage each publisher's settings independently.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Switcher Visibility (Multiple Publishers)
**Given** I am logged in with publisher_access_list containing multiple publisher IDs
**When** I navigate to /publisher
**Then** I see a publisher switcher dropdown in the dashboard header

### AC-2: Switcher Dropdown
**Given** the publisher switcher is visible
**When** I click on it
**Then** I see a list of all publishers I have access to (name + organization)

### AC-3: Switch Publisher
**Given** I select a different publisher from the switcher
**When** the selection is applied
**Then** the entire dashboard context switches to that publisher
**And** coverage, algorithm, analytics all reflect the selected publisher

### AC-4: Single Publisher (No Switcher)
**Given** I am logged in with only one publisher in publisher_access_list
**When** I navigate to /publisher
**Then** the switcher is hidden (or shows as static text)

### AC-5: Selection Persistence
**Given** I select a publisher
**When** I navigate between dashboard sections
**Then** the selected publisher persists until I switch again

## Technical Notes

### Frontend Changes

**File:** `web/components/publisher/PublisherSwitcher.tsx` (create)
```typescript
interface PublisherSwitcherProps {
  publishers: Publisher[];
  selectedId: string;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
}
```
- Use shadcn/ui Select or Popover component
- Show publisher name and organization in dropdown
- Highlight currently selected publisher

**File:** `web/providers/PublisherContext.tsx` (create)
```typescript
interface PublisherContextType {
  selectedPublisherId: string | null;
  setSelectedPublisherId: (id: string) => void;
  publishers: Publisher[];
  selectedPublisher: Publisher | null;
}
```
- Load publishers from Clerk metadata on mount
- Store selection in localStorage for persistence
- URL param override: `/publisher?p={id}` takes precedence

**File:** `web/hooks/usePublisherContext.ts` (create)
- Hook to access PublisherContext
- Convenience methods for common operations

**File:** `web/app/publisher/layout.tsx` (modify)
- Wrap with PublisherContextProvider
- Add PublisherSwitcher to header

### Backend Changes

**File:** `api/internal/handlers/publishers.go`
- All `/api/publisher/*` endpoints should validate user has access to requested publisher_id
- Accept `X-Publisher-Id` header or query param to specify context

### Data Flow

```
User Login → Clerk provides publicMetadata
    │
    └── Extract publisher_access_list
        │
        └── Fetch publisher details for each ID
            │
            └── Populate PublisherContext
                │
                └── Switcher shows list
                    │
                    └── Selection stored in:
                        ├── URL param (?p=...)
                        └── localStorage (fallback)
```

### API Endpoint

```
GET /api/publisher/accessible
Response: {
  publishers: [{
    id: string,
    name: string,
    organization: string,
    status: string
  }]
}
```
- Returns only publishers the current user has access to
- Used to populate switcher dropdown with full details
