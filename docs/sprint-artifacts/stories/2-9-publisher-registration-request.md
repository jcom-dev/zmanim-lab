# Story 2.9: Publisher Registration Request

**Epic:** Epic 2 - Publisher User Management & Dashboard
**Status:** Drafted
**Priority:** Medium
**Sprint Change:** Added 2025-11-26

---

## User Story

**As a** potential publisher,
**I want** to submit a registration request with my details,
**So that** I can become a publisher on Zmanim Lab after admin approval.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Public Registration Page
**Given** I am not logged in or logged in as a regular user
**When** I navigate to `/become-publisher`
**Then** I see a registration form with fields:
  - Name (required)
  - Organization (required)
  - Email address (required)
  - Website (optional)
  - Description/About (required, textarea)

### AC2: Form Validation
**Given** I am filling out the registration form
**When** I leave required fields empty
**Then** I see inline validation errors
**And** the form cannot be submitted

**Given** I enter an invalid email format
**When** I try to submit
**Then** I see an email validation error

### AC3: Successful Submission
**Given** I fill in all required fields correctly
**When** I submit the form
**Then** I see a confirmation message: "Thank you! Your request has been submitted. We'll review it and get back to you soon."
**And** my request is stored with status "pending"
**And** the form resets or redirects to home

### AC4: Admin Pending Requests View
**Given** I am an admin viewing `/admin/publishers`
**When** I look at the page
**Then** I see a "Pending Requests" section
**And** I see a badge with the count of pending requests
**And** I can click to expand/view the list

### AC5: Admin Request Details
**Given** I am an admin viewing pending requests
**When** I click on a request
**Then** I see full details: name, organization, email, website, description, submitted date
**And** I see "Approve" and "Reject" buttons

### AC6: Approve Request
**Given** I am an admin viewing a pending request
**When** I click "Approve"
**Then** a publisher account is created with the submitted details
**And** an approval email is sent via Resend
**And** the request status changes to "approved"
**And** the request moves out of pending list
**And** I see a success toast

### AC7: Reject Request
**Given** I am an admin viewing a pending request
**When** I click "Reject"
**Then** I can optionally enter a rejection reason
**And** the request status changes to "rejected"
**And** a rejection email is sent via Resend (if configured)
**And** the request moves out of pending list

### AC8: Duplicate Prevention
**Given** a request already exists for an email
**When** someone submits another request with the same email
**Then** they see a message: "A request for this email is already pending or has been processed."

import { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";

export default function BecomePublisherPage() {
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
        name: "",
        organization: "",
        email: "",
        website: "",
        description: "",
    });
    const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

    // Form implementation...
}
```

emailService.SendPublisherApproved(
    request.Email,
    request.Name,
