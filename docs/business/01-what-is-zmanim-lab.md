# What is Zmanim Lab?

## Overview

**Zmanim Lab** is a **Halachic Zmanim Publishing Platform** - a multi-publisher platform that empowers Jewish halachic authorities (rabbis, batei din, Orthodox communities) to publish customized prayer times (zmanim) with complete control over calculation algorithms and geographic coverage.

Think of it as "WordPress for Zmanim" - where any qualified halachic authority can become a publisher and define their own calculation methods without needing to code.

## The Big Picture

### What Are Zmanim?

**Zmanim** (Hebrew: זמנים, "times") are halachically significant times of day that determine when Jews can perform mitzvot (religious commandments), especially prayer times. Examples include:

- **Alos Hashachar** (dawn) - earliest time for morning prayers
- **Sof Zman Shma** (latest Shema time) - deadline for reciting morning Shema
- **Chatzos** (midday) - exact solar noon
- **Tzeis Hakochavim** (nightfall) - when three stars appear, marking end of Shabbat

### The Challenge

Calculating zmanim is complex because:

1. **Astronomical precision required** - Based on sun position, sunrise, sunset, solar angles
2. **Geographic variation** - Different locations have different times
3. **Multiple halachic opinions** - Different rabbinic authorities use different methods:
   - **GRA (Vilna Gaon)** vs. **Magen Avraham (MGA)** for proportional hours
   - Different solar depression angles (16.1°, 18°, 19.8° for dawn)
   - Fixed minutes (72, 90 minutes) vs. angular calculations
4. **No centralized source of truth** - Each community follows their own authority

### What Makes Zmanim Lab Special

Zmanim Lab solves this through **two-sided transparency**:

#### For Publishers (Halachic Authorities):
- **Friendly UI** - Configure complex algorithms without writing code
- **Visual formula builder** - Drag-and-drop calculation method selection
- **AI assistance** - Describe what you want in plain language, get valid formula
- **Live preview** - See calculated times instantly as you edit
- **Geographic control** - Define service areas by continent, country, region, or city
- **Full customization** - Every zman, every parameter, exactly your way

#### For End Users:
- **Transparency** - Click any time to see exactly how it was calculated
- **Authority-specific** - Choose zmanim from your trusted rabbi
- **Location-first** - Start with your city, find publishers serving you
- **Multi-language** - Hebrew and English throughout
- **Mobile-friendly** - Access from phone, tablet, or desktop

## Why Zmanim Lab Exists

### The Core Mission

**Democratize zmanim publishing** - Any qualified halachic authority should be able to publish their calculation methods without needing technical expertise, while end users gain transparency into exactly how their prayer times are calculated.

### Problems It Solves

#### Problem 1: Technical Barrier for Authorities
**Before:** A rabbi who wanted to publish zmanim for their community needed to:
1. Hire a developer
2. Maintain a custom app or website
3. Pay ongoing hosting costs
4. Handle bugs and updates

**After:** The rabbi:
1. Signs up on Zmanim Lab
2. Uses the visual editor to define formulas (or describes them to AI)
3. Selects geographic coverage
4. Publishes - done!

#### Problem 2: Black Box for Users
**Before:** Users saw a time (e.g., "6:42 AM") but had no idea:
- Which method was used
- Which rabbi endorsed it
- Why it differs from other apps

**After:** Users click any time and see:
- The exact formula: "18° below horizon" or "72 fixed minutes before sunrise"
- The rabbi/organization name
- A plain-language explanation

#### Problem 3: Algorithm Fragmentation
**Before:** Every zmanim app picked one method ("our way or the highway"):
- MyZmanim uses one set of algorithms
- Chabad.org uses another
- KosherJava has defaults
- Users can't follow their specific rav's psak (ruling)

**After:** Zmanim Lab is **multi-publisher**:
- User searches for "Brooklyn, NY"
- Sees: Rabbi Goldstein (Crown Heights), Rabbi Cohen (Flatbush), Rabbi Weiss (Boro Park)
- Selects their community's authority
- Gets that authority's exact calculations

#### Problem 4: No Collaboration
**Before:** Rabbis worked in isolation. If Rabbi A figured out a great formula for Mincha Ketana, Rabbi B couldn't easily adopt it.

**After:** Publishers can:
- Copy/fork other publishers' algorithms (with attribution)
- Request new zmanim to be added to the master registry
- See what formulas other authorities are using
- Build on community knowledge

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Multi-Publisher Architecture
**Not a single-algorithm app** - Each publisher has their own algorithms. Users choose their authority.

### 2. Two-Sided Transparency
**Publishers:** Visual editor makes algorithm creation friendly 
** Users:** Formula reveal shows exactly how times are calculated

### 3. AI-Powered Formula Generation
**Unique Innovation:** Describe calculation in natural language → Claude AI generates valid DSL formula  
Example: "Dawn when sun is 16.1 degrees below horizon" → `solar(16.1, before_sunrise)`

### 4. Bilingual Throughout
**Hebrew + English** for all zmanim names, explanations, and UI elements

### 5. Geographic Precision
**PostGIS-powered** - Continent/country/region/city hierarchy  
**Flexible coverage** - Publisher can serve a single city or an entire continent

### 6. Collaborative Ecosystem
- **Master Zman Registry**: Community-driven catalog of calculation methods
- **Copy/Fork**: Publishers can adopt others' formulas (with attribution)
- **Request System**: Publishers request new zmanim → Admin approves → Available to all
- **Tag System**: Organize zmanim by events (Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur), timing methods (GRA, MGA), behaviors

### 7. Educational Transparency
**Not just "what time"** but **"why this time"**:
- Shows calculation method
- Explains parameters
- Links formulas to halachic sources (optional publisher notes)
