### Story 1.7: Calculation Engine & Caching

**As the** system,
**I want** to calculate accurate zmanim times,
**So that** users receive correct prayer times based on publisher algorithms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a location with latitude, longitude, and timezone
**When** I request zmanim calculation for a specific date
**Then** the system calculates all standard zmanim times

**Given** an algorithm specifies solar_angle method with 16.1 degrees for Alos
**When** calculation runs
**Then** Alos time is when sun is 16.1° below horizon (before sunrise)

**Given** an algorithm specifies fixed_minutes method with 72 minutes for Tzeis
**When** calculation runs
**Then** Tzeis time is exactly 72 minutes after sunset

**Given** an algorithm specifies proportional method with 3 hours GRA for Sof Zman Shma
**When** calculation runs
**Then** the time is 3 proportional hours (shaos zmaniyos) after sunrise
**And** proportional hour = (sunset - sunrise) / 12

**Given** an algorithm specifies proportional method with MGA base
**When** calculation runs
**Then** proportional hours are calculated from Alos to Tzeis (not sunrise to sunset)

**Given** calculated times
**When** returned to the API
**Then** times include the formula details (method, parameters) for each zman

**Given** a zmanim calculation is requested
**When** the same publisher/city/date was calculated within 24 hours
**Then** the cached result is returned from Upstash Redis (<100ms response)

**Given** a cached calculation exists
**When** the publisher updates their algorithm
**Then** the cache for that publisher is invalidated

**Given** the cache is empty or expired
**When** a calculation is requested
**Then** the result is calculated, cached with 24hr TTL, and returned

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.2 (Foundation & Auth)

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `api/internal/astro/` package:
  - `sun.go` - sunrise/sunset calculations using solar position algorithms
  - `angles.go` - solar depression angle calculations
  - `times.go` - time arithmetic and proportional hours
- Create `api/internal/services/algorithm/`:
  - `parser.go` - parse algorithm DSL JSON
  - `executor.go` - execute algorithm against date/location
  - `methods.go` - implement calculation methods
- Reference kosher-zmanim for algorithm inspiration but implement from scratch
- Test against known reference values (e.g., MyZmanim, Chabad.org)
- All times in UTC internally, convert to local timezone on output
- Create `api/internal/services/cache_service.go`:
  - Use Upstash Redis REST API (github.com/upstash/go-upstash-redis)
  - Cache key format: `zmanim:{publisher_id}:{city_id}:{date}`
  - TTL: 24 hours
  - Invalidation: Pattern delete on algorithm publish
- Environment variables: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

**FRs:** FR27, FR32, FR33

### Story 1.8: Algorithm Editor

**As a** publisher,
**I want** to configure my zmanim calculation algorithm,
**So that** my community receives times according to my halachic opinions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am a verified publisher
**When** I navigate to /publisher/algorithm
**Then** I see my current algorithm configuration (or empty state if none)

**Given** I am creating a new algorithm
**When** I click "Start from Template"
**Then** I can choose: Standard GRA, Magen Avraham, Rabbeinu Tam, or Custom

**Given** I am editing an algorithm
**When** I click on a zman (e.g., Alos Hashachar)
**Then** a modal opens with configuration options:
- Method: Solar Angle / Fixed Minutes / Proportional
- Parameters based on method (degrees, minutes, hours, base)

**Given** I configure Alos with solar_angle 16.1°
**When** I look at the preview panel
**Then** I see the calculated time for today's date at a sample location

**Given** I click "View Month"
**When** the preview expands
**Then** I see a calendar month view with all zmanim for each day

**Given** I enter invalid configuration (e.g., negative degrees)
**When** I try to save
**Then** I see validation error and cannot save

**Given** I have unsaved changes
**When** I try to navigate away
**Then** I am warned about losing changes

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.7 (Calculation Engine & Caching)

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `web/app/publisher/algorithm/page.tsx`
- Create `web/components/publisher/AlgorithmEditor.tsx`:
  - List of zmanim with current configuration
  - Modal for editing each zman
  - Live preview panel
  - Month view expansion
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog, Select, Input components
- Algorithm stored as JSON DSL (see architecture):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Algorithm",
    "zmanim": {
      "alos": {"method": "solar_angle", "params": {"degrees": 16.1}},
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

**I want** to publish my algorithm to make it active,
**So that** end users can see zmanim calculated with my method.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I have a configured algorithm in draft status
**When** I click "Publish"
**Then** the algorithm becomes active and visible to users

**Given** I have a published algorithm
**When** I make changes and save
**Then** changes are saved as a new draft version
**And** the published version remains active

**Given** I have draft changes
**When** I click "Publish Changes"
**Then** the draft becomes the new active version
**And** the old version is archived

**Given** I have multiple algorithm versions
**When** I view version history
**Then** I see all versions with dates and can compare

**Given** I have an old published version
**When** I click "Deprecate"
**Then** that version is marked deprecated
**And** users on that version see a notice to refresh

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.8 (Algorithm Editor)

**Technical Notes:**
- Add version management to algorithm table:
  ```sql
  algorithms (id, publisher_id, version, config, status, created_at)
  ```
  - `status`: 'draft', 'published', 'deprecated'
- API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/publisher/algorithm/publish` - publish current draft
  - `GET /api/publisher/algorithm/versions` - list versions
  - `PUT /api/publisher/algorithm/versions/{id}/deprecate`
- Only one active (published) version per publisher at a time

## Epic 5: DSL Editor Experience & Zman Management

**Status:** CURRENT SPRINT
**Stories:** 18 (5.0 - 5.17)
**FRs:** FR96-FR120 (Editor Experience & Zman Management)

**Goal:** Deliver a "hand-holding" DSL editor experience for non-technical users, plus publisher zman customization and new zman request workflow.

**User Value:** A rabbi who knows halacha but not programming can define formulas in under 30 seconds with zero confusion. Publishers can customize zman names and request new zmanim, creating a community-driven master registry.

See detailed specifications:
- [ux-dsl-editor-inline-guidance.md](ux-dsl-editor-inline-guidance.md)

---

### Story 5.0: Database Schema for Publisher Aliases & Zman Requests

**As a** developer,
**I want** the database schema extended for publisher zman aliases and enhanced zman requests,
**So that** we have the data layer for all Epic 5 features.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Database Migrations" (migration file naming, idempotent SQL)
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the migration is applied
**When** I query the database
**Then** the `publisher_zman_aliases` table exists with:
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `publisher_id` (FK to publishers)
- `publisher_zman_id` (FK to publisher_zmanim)
- `custom_hebrew_name` (TEXT, required)
- `custom_english_name` (TEXT, required)
- `custom_transliteration` (TEXT, optional)
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN, default true)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- UNIQUE constraint on (publisher_id, publisher_zman_id)

**And** the `zman_registry_requests` table is enhanced with:
- `transliteration` (TEXT)
- `description` (TEXT)
- `halachic_notes` (TEXT)
- `halachic_source` (TEXT)
- `publisher_email` (TEXT)
- `publisher_name` (TEXT)
- `auto_add_on_approval` (BOOLEAN, default true)

**And** the `zman_request_tags` table exists with:
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `request_id` (FK to zman_registry_requests)
- `tag_id` (FK to zman_tags, nullable for new tag requests)
- `requested_tag_name` (TEXT, for new tag requests)
- `requested_tag_type` (TEXT, constrained to valid types)
- `is_new_tag_request` (BOOLEAN)
- CHECK constraint ensuring either tag_id or requested_tag_name is set

**Prerequisites:** None (first story of Epic 5)

**Technical Notes:**
- Create migration `00000000000023_publisher_zman_aliases.sql`
- Create migration `00000000000024_enhance_zman_registry_requests.sql`
- Regenerate SQLc code after migrations
- Add appropriate indexes for query performance

**FRs:** Infrastructure for FR96-FR115

### Story 5.1: Human-Friendly Error Messages

**As a** non-technical publisher,
**I want** error messages that explain what's wrong in plain language,
**So that** I can fix formula errors without understanding programming jargon.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Error Handling Standards > Frontend Error Handling"
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I type an invalid formula like `sunrise solar 11 before`
**When** the validation runs
**Then** I see a friendly error like:
- Headline: "Oops! `solar` needs parentheses to work."
- Suggestion: "Try: `solar(16.1, before_sunrise)`"
- An "Insert this example" button

**Given** I type `solar(120, before_sunrise)` (degrees too high)
**When** the validation runs
**Then** I see:
- Headline: "120° is too high."
- Explanation: "The sun can only be 0-90° below the horizon."
- Suggestion: "Common values: 8.5° (tzeis), 16.1° (alos), 18° (astronomical)"

**Given** I type `solar(16.1)` (missing argument)
**When** the validation runs
**Then** I see:
- Headline: "Almost there! `solar()` needs two things."
- Explanation: "A number for degrees AND a direction."
- Example with parameter breakdown

**Given** I type an unknown primitive like `sunrise2`
**When** the validation runs
**Then** I see:
- Headline: "I don't recognize 'sunrise2'."
- Suggestion: "Did you mean `sunrise`?"

**Given** the backend returns an error with a suggestion
**When** the frontend displays it
**Then** the backend suggestion is shown (not overridden by frontend mapping)

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.0

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `web/lib/error-humanizer.ts` with pattern matching
- Modify backend validator to include error codes
- Create `HumanErrorDisplay.tsx` component
- Integrate with existing error display in CodeMirrorDSLEditor
- Map all common errors per UX spec Appendix A

**FRs:** FR96 (Human-friendly validation feedback)

---

### Story 5.2: Contextual Tooltips in DSL Editor

**As a** non-technical publisher,
**I want** helpful hints that appear exactly where my cursor is,
**So that** I know what values to type without looking at documentation.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Frontend Standards > Unified API Client" (if fetching tooltip data)
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** my cursor is inside `solar(` after the opening parenthesis
**When** I pause for 100ms
**Then** a tooltip appears showing:
- Title: "📐 Degrees: Sun angle below horizon (0-90)"
- Common values: 8.5° (tzeis), 11° (misheyakir), 16.1° (alos), 18° (astronomical)
- "Type a number, e.g., 16.1"

**Given** my cursor is after the first comma in `solar(16.1,`
**When** I pause for 100ms
**Then** a tooltip appears showing:
- Title: "🧭 Direction: When does this angle occur?"
- Clickable buttons: before_sunrise, after_sunset, before_noon, after_noon
- Clicking a button inserts that value

**Given** my cursor is inside `proportional_hours(`
**When** I pause for 100ms
**Then** a tooltip appears showing hour values (3, 4, 6, 9.5, 10.75) with their meanings

**Given** I press Escape or click outside the tooltip
**When** the tooltip is visible
**Then** the tooltip dismisses

**Given** I click an option in the tooltip
**When** it inserts the value
**Then** the tooltip dismisses and cursor advances

**Given** I'm on mobile (touch interface)
**When** I tap in a parameter position
**Then** the tooltip appears and I can tap options to insert

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.1

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `web/lib/dsl-context-helper.ts` to parse cursor position context
- Create `web/components/editor/ContextualTooltip.tsx`
- Use CodeMirror `EditorView.updateListener` for cursor tracking
- Position tooltip relative to cursor coordinates
- Leverage existing `halachic-glossary.ts` for content
- Ensure keyboard accessibility (arrow key navigation)

**FRs:** FR97 (Contextual inline guidance)

---

### Story 5.3: Smart Placeholders with Real Examples

**As a** non-technical publisher,
**I want** function templates to show real examples instead of abstract placeholders,
**So that** I can immediately understand the correct format.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I click "solar()" in the reference panel
**When** the function is inserted
**Then** the editor shows `solar(16.1, before_sunrise)` (not `solar(degrees, direction)`)
**And** the `16.1` is selected/highlighted so I can immediately type my value

**Given** I click "proportional_hours()" in the reference panel
**When** the function is inserted
**Then** the editor shows `proportional_hours(4, gra)` (not `proportional_hours(hours, base)`)
**And** the `4` is selected

**Given** I have inserted a function with example values
**When** I press Tab
**Then** the cursor moves to the next parameter (e.g., from degrees to direction)
**And** the contextual tooltip appears for that parameter

**Given** I hover over a function in the reference panel
**When** the info appears
**Then** I see "Quick insert:" with clickable chips for common values (e.g., [8.5°] [11°] [16.1°] [18°])

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.2

**Technical Notes:**
- Modify `web/lib/dsl-reference-data.ts` to include `realWorldExample` property
- Update reference panel insert behavior to use examples
- Implement Tab-to-next-parameter using CodeMirror field markers
- Add quick-insert chips to reference panel entries

**FRs:** FR98 (Smart placeholders with examples)

### Story 5.4: Publisher Zman Alias API

**As a** publisher,
**I want** to create custom names for zmanim in my algorithm,
**So that** my community sees familiar terminology while the system maintains canonical references.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Backend Standards > Handler Structure" (6-step pattern)
- "Backend Standards > Response Format" (use RespondJSON correctly)
- "Error Handling Standards > Backend Error Handling"
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am an authenticated publisher with a published zman
**When** I call `PUT /api/v1/publisher/zmanim/{zmanKey}/alias` with:
```json
{
  "custom_hebrew_name": "עמוד השחר",
  "custom_english_name": "Dawn Column",
  "custom_transliteration": "Amud HaShachar"
}
```
**Then** the alias is created/updated
**And** I receive a 200 response with the alias details including canonical names

**Given** I have an alias for a zman
**When** I call `GET /api/v1/publisher/zmanim/{zmanKey}/alias`
**Then** I receive both my custom name AND the canonical master registry name

**Given** I have an alias for a zman
**When** I call `DELETE /api/v1/publisher/zmanim/{zmanKey}/alias`
**Then** the alias is removed
**And** the zman reverts to showing canonical names

**Given** I have multiple aliases
**When** I call `GET /api/v1/publisher/zmanim/aliases`
**Then** I receive all my aliases with both custom and canonical names

**Given** a user views my zmanim
**When** the API returns zman data
**Then** both the custom name (if exists) and canonical name are included

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.0

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `api/internal/handlers/publisher_aliases.go`
- Add SQLc queries for alias CRUD operations
- Include canonical names in responses from `master_zmanim_registry`
- Register routes in publisher router

**FRs:** FR99 (Publisher zman custom naming), FR100 (Canonical name visibility)

---

### Story 5.5: Publisher Zman Alias UI

**As a** publisher,
**I want** to rename zmanim in the Advanced DSL editor,
**So that** I can customize display names while seeing the original canonical name.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Unified API Client" (use useApi hook)
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am editing a zman in Advanced DSL mode
**When** I view the zman settings
**Then** I see a "Custom Display Name" section (not visible in Guided Builder)

**Given** I am in the Custom Display Name section
**When** I see the current state
**Then** I see the canonical name from master registry displayed as "Original: [name]"

**Given** I want to rename a zman
**When** I enter custom Hebrew name, English name, and transliteration
**Then** I can save the alias
**And** the canonical name remains visible in a subtle "Original: X" label

**Given** I have a custom name set
**When** I view the zman card in my algorithm list
**Then** I see my custom name prominently with canonical name in parentheses or subtitle

**Given** I want to revert to canonical naming
**When** I click "Remove Custom Name" or clear all fields
**Then** the alias is deleted and canonical names are used

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.4

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `web/components/publisher/ZmanAliasEditor.tsx`
- Modify `web/app/publisher/algorithm/edit/[zman_key]/page.tsx` to include alias editor
- Only show in Advanced DSL mode (check for mode flag)
- Show clear visual distinction between custom and canonical names

**FRs:** FR99, FR100

---

### Story 5.6: Request New Zman API & Email Notifications

**As a** publisher,
**I want** to submit a request for a new zman to be added to the master registry,
**So that** I can use zmanim not currently in the system.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Backend Standards > Handler Structure" (6-step pattern)
- "Backend Standards > Response Format" (use RespondJSON correctly)
- "Error Handling Standards > Backend Error Handling"
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am an authenticated publisher
**When** I call `POST /api/v1/publisher/zmanim/request` with:
```json
{
  "hebrew_name": "שקיעת החמה המאוחרת",
  "english_name": "Late Sunset",
  "time_category": "evening",
  "justification": "Needed for Rabbeinu Tam calculations",
  "existing_tag_ids": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2"],
  "new_tag_requests": [
    {"name": "Rabbeinu Tam", "tag_type": "shita", "description": "72 minutes method"}
  ],
  "formula_dsl": "sunset + 72min",
  "auto_add_on_approval": true
}
```
**Then** the request is created with status "pending"
**And** I receive a confirmation email
**And** admin receives a notification email with review link

**Given** I submit a request with formula_dsl
**When** the backend processes it
**Then** the formula is validated
**And** validation errors are returned if invalid (request still created but flagged)

**Given** a request only requires hebrew_name, english_name, and justification
**When** I submit with minimal fields
**Then** the request is accepted (most fields optional)

**Given** I want to see my pending requests
**When** I call `GET /api/v1/publisher/zmanim/requests`
**Then** I receive a list of my requests with status

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.0

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `api/internal/handlers/zman_requests.go`
- Add SQLc queries for request CRUD
- Extend `email_service.go` with new templates:
  - `TemplateZmanRequestSubmitted` (to publisher)
  - `TemplateAdminNewZmanRequest` (to admin)
- Validate formula_dsl if provided (but allow request even if invalid)

**FRs:** FR101 (Request new zman), FR102 (Guided tag selection), FR103 (Optional formula), FR104 (Email on submission)

### Story 5.7: Request New Zman UI

**As a** publisher,
**I want** a guided form to request new zmanim,
**So that** I can submit complete requests with proper tags and optional formulas.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Unified API Client" (use useApi hook)
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**When** the page loads
**Then** I see a multi-step form with progress indicator

**Given** I am on Step 1 (Names)
**When** I fill in the form
**Then** Hebrew Name and English Name are required (marked with *)
**And** Transliteration is optional

**Given** I am on Step 2 (Classification)
**When** I see the tag selection
**Then** I can browse existing tags by category (event, timing, behavior, shita, method)
**And** I can multi-select tags
**And** I see a "Request New Tag" button

**Given** I click "Request New Tag"
**When** the dialog opens
**Then** I can enter: tag name, tag type (dropdown), description
**And** the new tag request is attached to my zman request

**Given** I am on Step 3 (Formula - Optional)
**When** I see the formula input
**Then** it's clearly marked as optional
**And** I see a simplified DSL editor (same as advanced mode but smaller)
**And** validation runs but doesn't block submission

**Given** I am on Step 4 (Review & Submit)
**When** I review my request
**Then** I see all entered data formatted nicely
**And** I must provide a Justification (required)
**And** I see "Auto-add to my zmanim on approval" checkbox (default checked)

**Given** I submit the request
**When** the API responds successfully
**Then** I see a success message with confirmation email notice
**And** I'm redirected to my requests list

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.6

**Technical Notes:**
- Create `web/app/publisher/zmanim/request/page.tsx`
- Create `web/components/publisher/ZmanRequestForm.tsx` (multi-step)

### Story 5.8: Admin Zman Request Review Page

**As an** admin,
**I want** a page to review and manage zman requests,
**So that** I can approve or reject publisher submissions.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Unified API Client" (use useApi hook)
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Backend Standards > Handler Structure" (6-step pattern)
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**When** I navigate to `/admin/zmanim/requests`
**Then** I see a table of zman requests with columns:
- Publisher Name
- Hebrew Name / English Name
- Time Category
- Status (pending/approved/rejected)
- Submitted Date
- Actions

**Given** I view the requests table
**When** I want to filter
**Then** I can filter by status (pending, approved, rejected, all)
**And** I can search by publisher name or zman name

**Given** I click on a request row
**When** the detail panel opens
**Then** I see:
- All submitted fields
- Formula (if provided) with validation status
- Requested tags (existing + new tag requests)
- Justification

**Given** I click "Approve"
**When** the approval dialog opens
**Then** I must set:
- `zman_key` (admin-defined, unique identifier)
- Sort order (where it appears in lists)
- Whether to create requested new tags
- Which tags to apply
- Optional admin notes

**Given** I submit approval
**When** the backend processes it
**Then** the zman is added to master registry
**And** if auto_add_on_approval was true, it's added to publisher's zmanim
**And** publisher receives approval email with zman details

**Given** I click "Reject"
**When** the rejection dialog opens
**Then** I must provide a rejection reason
**And** publisher receives rejection email with reason

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.6

**Technical Notes:**

### Story 5.9: Reference Panel Contextual Enhancements

**As a** non-technical publisher,
**I want** the reference panel to highlight where I am in my formula,
**So that** I always know what documentation is relevant.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** my cursor is inside `solar(16.1, before_sunrise)`
**When** I look at the reference panel
**Then** the `solar()` function entry is highlighted
**And** I see a "YOU ARE HERE" indicator on the current parameter

**Given** my cursor is at the degrees position
**When** I look at the highlighted solar() entry
**Then** the degrees parameter is expanded with:
- Description: "0-90 (sun angle below horizon)"
- Quick-insert chips: [8.5°] [11°] [16.1°] [18°]

**Given** I click a quick-insert chip like [16.1°]
**When** the value is inserted
**Then** it replaces the current parameter value in my formula
**And** cursor moves to next parameter

**Given** my cursor is not inside any function
**When** I look at the reference panel
**Then** no function is specially highlighted (normal state)

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.3

**Technical Notes:**
- Modify `web/components/editor/DSLReferencePanel.tsx`
- Use cursor context from `dsl-context-helper.ts`

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Unified API Client" (use useApi hook for uploads)
- "Frontend Standards > Component Structure"
- "Backend Standards > Handler Structure" (for upload endpoint)
- "Development Workflow > Service Restart" (always use `./restart.sh`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am creating or editing my publisher profile
**When** I view the logo section
**Then** logo upload is REQUIRED (marked with *)
**And** I cannot save my profile without a logo

**Given** I don't have a logo image
**When** I click "Generate from Initials"
**Then** the system creates a logo using my publisher name initials
**And** I can customize the background color
**And** the generated logo is displayed in preview

**Given** I upload an image
**When** the image loads
**Then** I see an image editor with:
- Crop selection box (drag to resize/reposition)
- Zoom in/out controls (+/- buttons or slider)
- Pan/drag the image within the crop area
- Aspect ratio locked to 1:1 (square)
- Preview of final result at actual display size

**Given** I have positioned the crop area
**When** I click "Apply"
**Then** the image is cropped and resized to 200x200px (or defined standard size)
**And** the preview updates to show the final logo

**Given** the publisher name field exists
**When** I view the field label
**Then** it reads "Publisher Name" (not "Name")
**And** helper text says "Organization or publication name (not personal name)"

**Given** I try to enter what looks like a personal name (e.g., "Rabbi David Cohen")
**When** I focus out of the field
**Then** I see a warning: "This appears to be a personal name. Publisher names should be organization names like 'Beth Israel Congregation' or 'Chicago Rabbinical Council'"

**Given** a publisher is displayed anywhere in the app
**When** I see the publisher reference
**Then** it uses "Publisher Name" terminology consistently (not just "Name")

**Prerequisites:** None (can be done in parallel with other Epic 5 stories)

**Technical Notes:**
- Make `logo_url` required in publisher profile validation
- Create `web/components/publisher/LogoEditor.tsx` using:
  - react-image-crop or react-easy-crop library
  - Canvas API for final crop/resize
- Create `web/components/publisher/InitialsLogoGenerator.tsx`
  - Generate SVG or canvas-based logo from initials
  - Color picker for background
- Standard logo size: 200x200px (stored), displayed at various sizes via CSS
- Update all UI text from "Name" to "Publisher Name" where appropriate
- Add name validation regex to detect likely personal names
- Store cropped image to Supabase Storage or existing CDN

**FRs:** FR110 (Mandatory logo), FR111 (Logo image editor), FR112 (Initials generator), FR113 (Publisher name not personal name)

### Story 5.11: Frontend API Client Migration (useApi Hook)

**As a** developer,
**I want** all frontend API calls to use the unified `useApi()` hook,
**So that** authentication headers and response handling are consistent across the application.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Frontend Standards > Unified API Client"
- "Technical Debt Audit > Current Violation Counts"
- "Enforcement Mechanisms"

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Auth inconsistencies cause 401 errors and poor UX
- **Current Violations:** 73 raw `fetch()` calls in .tsx files
- **Impact:** Missing auth tokens, inconsistent error handling, duplicated code

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the codebase has 73 raw `fetch()` calls in .tsx files
**When** Story 5.11 is complete
**Then** all `fetch()` calls use `useApi()` hook instead
**And** running `grep -r "await fetch(" web/app web/components --include="*.tsx"` returns 0 results

**Given** a component makes an authenticated API request
**When** using the `useApi()` hook
**Then** the Authorization header is automatically included
**And** the X-Publisher-Id header is included for publisher routes
**And** response data is automatically unwrapped from `{data: ..., meta: ...}` format

**Given** a component makes a public API request
**When** using `api.public.get()` or similar
**Then** no authentication headers are included
**And** the request succeeds without Clerk token

**Prerequisites:** None (can run in parallel with other Epic 5 stories)

**Technical Notes:**

**Files to Update (73 instances):**
```bash
# Run to get full list:
grep -r "await fetch(" web/app web/components --include="*.tsx"
```

**Migration Pattern:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (violation):
const API_BASE = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/v1/publisher/profile`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'X-Publisher-Id': publisherId,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const json = await response.json();
const data = json.data;

// AFTER (compliant):
import { useApi } from '@/lib/api-client';

const api = useApi();
const data = await api.get('/publisher/profile');
// Auth headers and response unwrapping handled automatically
```

**Request Types:**
- `api.get('/endpoint')` - Authenticated with publisher ID
- `api.post('/endpoint', { body: JSON.stringify(data) })` - POST with auth
- `api.public.get('/endpoint')` - No authentication
- `api.admin.get('/endpoint')` - Auth but no publisher ID

**Validation Command:**
```bash
grep -r "await fetch(" web/app web/components --include="*.tsx" | wc -l  # Should be 0
```

**Story Points:** 5

**FRs:** FR114 (Standards enforcement - useApi)

---

### Story 5.12: Backend Structured Logging Migration (slog)

**As a** developer,
**I want** all backend logging to use structured `slog` with context,
**So that** logs are searchable, debuggable, and provide meaningful context for incident response.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Backend Standards > Error Handling"
- "Technical Debt Audit > Current Violation Counts"
- "Exemptions" (api/cmd/ is exempt)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 🟠 HIGH - Unstructured logs slow incident response
- **Current Violations:** ~100 `log.Printf/fmt.Printf` calls in handlers/services
- **Impact:** Missing context in logs, difficult debugging, inconsistent log format

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the codebase has ~100 `log.Printf/fmt.Printf` calls in handlers/services
**When** Story 5.12 is complete
**Then** all logging uses `slog` with structured context
**And** running `grep -rE "log.Printf|fmt.Printf" api/internal/handlers api/internal/services --include="*.go"` returns 0 results

**Given** an error occurs in a handler
**When** the error is logged
**Then** the log includes: error message, error object, publisher_id, user_id, and operation context
**And** the log level is appropriate (Error for errors, Info for operations, Debug for verbose)

**Given** CLI tools in `api/cmd/`
**When** they use `log.Printf` or `fmt.Printf`
**Then** this is acceptable (exempt from standards)

**Prerequisites:** None (can run in parallel with other Epic 5 stories)

**Technical Notes:**

**Files to Update:**
```bash
# Run to get full list (handlers and services only):
grep -rE "log\.Printf|fmt\.Printf|fmt\.Println" api/internal/handlers api/internal/services --include="*.go"
```

**Migration Pattern:**
```go
// BEFORE (violation):
log.Printf("ERROR [GetPublisherProfile] Query failed: %v (publisherID=%s)", err, publisherID)

// AFTER (compliant):
slog.Error("query failed",
    "error", err,
    "publisher_id", publisherID,
    "user_id", userID,
    "operation", "GetPublisherProfile",
)
```

**Log Levels:**
- `slog.Error()` - Errors that need attention
- `slog.Warn()` - Potential issues, degraded functionality
- `slog.Info()` - Important operations (user actions, state changes)
- `slog.Debug()` - Verbose debugging (disabled in production)

**Context Fields to Include:**
- `error` - The error object (for Error/Warn)
- `publisher_id` - Publisher context
- `user_id` - User context (from Clerk)
- `operation` - Handler/function name
- `request_id` - From middleware if available

**Validation Command:**
```bash
grep -rE "log\.Printf|fmt\.Printf|fmt\.Println" api/internal/handlers api/internal/services --include="*.go" | wc -l  # Should be 0
```

**Story Points:** 3

**FRs:** FR114 (Standards enforcement - slog)

### Story 5.13: E2E Test Deterministic Waits Migration

**As a** developer,
**I want** all E2E tests to use deterministic wait strategies,
**So that** tests are reliable, fast, and don't flake in CI.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Testing Standards > E2E Test Pattern"
- "Technical Debt Audit > Current Violation Counts"
- See also `.bmad/bmm/testarch/knowledge/test-quality.md` for detailed patterns

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 🟠 HIGH - Flaky tests erode developer confidence and slow CI
- **Current Violations:** 52 `waitForTimeout` hard waits
- **Impact:** Non-deterministic tests, slow CI, false failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the test suite has 52 `waitForTimeout` hard waits
**When** Story 5.13 is complete
**Then** all waits use deterministic strategies
**And** running `grep -r "waitForTimeout" tests/e2e --include="*.ts"` returns 0 results

**Given** a test needs to wait for an API response
**When** the test uses `page.waitForResponse()`
**Then** the test waits only until the response arrives (not arbitrary time)

**Given** a test needs to wait for UI to update
**When** the test uses `expect().toBeVisible()` or `waitForSelector()`
**Then** the test waits only until the element appears (not arbitrary time)

**Prerequisites:** None (can run in parallel with other Epic 5 stories)

**Technical Notes:**

**Files to Update (52 instances):**
```bash
# Run to get full list:
grep -r "waitForTimeout" tests/e2e --include="*.ts"
```

**Migration Patterns:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (violation):
await page.waitForTimeout(1000);

// AFTER - Option 1: Wait for network idle
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

// AFTER - Option 2: Wait for specific API response
await page.waitForResponse(resp =>
  resp.url().includes('/api/v1/publisher') && resp.status() === 200
);

// AFTER - Option 3: Wait for element visibility
await expect(page.getByText('Dashboard')).toBeVisible();

// AFTER - Option 4: Wait for element state
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' }).waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
```

**Utility Functions Available:**
See `tests/e2e/utils/wait-helpers.ts` for existing helpers.

**Decision Guide:**
| Scenario | Use This |
|----------|----------|
| After navigation | `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` |
| After form submit | `waitForResponse(/api\/endpoint/)` |
| After click/action | `expect(element).toBeVisible()` |
| After state change | `waitFor({ state: 'visible' })` |

**Validation Command:**
```bash
grep -r "waitForTimeout" tests/e2e --include="*.ts" | wc -l  # Should be 0
```

**Story Points:** 5

**FRs:** FR115 (Technical debt reduction - deterministic waits)

### Story 5.14: E2E Test Parallel Mode Configuration

**As a** developer,
**I want** all E2E test files to have parallel mode configured,
**So that** tests run faster in CI and are guaranteed to be isolated.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Testing Standards > E2E Test Pattern"
- "Technical Debt Audit > Current Violation Counts"

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Slower CI and potential state pollution
- **Current Violations:** 23/29 test files missing parallel mode
- **Impact:** Slower CI pipeline, tests may have hidden dependencies

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** only 6/29 test files have parallel mode configured
**When** Story 5.14 is complete
**Then** all spec files include `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' })`
**And** all tests pass when run with `--workers=4`

**Given** a test file has parallel mode enabled
**When** tests in that file run
**Then** each test is isolated and doesn't depend on other tests' state
**And** tests can run in any order

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.13 (deterministic waits must be fixed first to ensure parallel safety)

**Technical Notes:**

**Files Missing Parallel Mode (23 files):**
```bash
# Files that HAVE parallel mode (6):
tests/e2e/publisher/coverage.spec.ts
tests/e2e/publisher/team.spec.ts
tests/e2e/public/public-pages.spec.ts
tests/e2e/publisher/algorithm-editor.spec.ts
tests/e2e/publisher/onboarding.spec.ts
tests/e2e/auth/authentication.spec.ts

# All other spec files need parallel mode added
```

**Migration Pattern:**
```typescript
// Add at the top of each describe block:
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });  // ADD THIS LINE

  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

**Parallel Safety Checklist:**
- [ ] Tests don't share mutable state
- [ ] Tests use unique data (faker or unique IDs)
- [ ] Tests clean up after themselves
- [ ] Tests don't depend on execution order

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Verify all spec files have parallel mode
for f in tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts; do
  grep -q "mode: 'parallel'" "$f" || echo "Missing: $f"
done

# Run tests in parallel to verify
npx playwright test --workers=4
```

### Story 5.15: Backend API Response Standardization

**As a** developer,
**I want** all API handlers to use consistent response formatting,
**So that** frontend can rely on predictable response structures.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Backend Standards > Handler Structure"
- "Backend Standards > Response Format"
- "Technical Debt Audit > Current Violation Counts"

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Inconsistent API contracts cause frontend bugs
- **Current Violations:** ~80 handlers double-wrap responses
- **Impact:** Frontend must handle both `data.publishers` and `data.data.publishers`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** ~80 handlers double-wrap API responses
**When** Story 5.15 is complete
**Then** handlers pass data directly to `RespondJSON()`
**And** frontend receives consistent `{data: ..., meta: ...}` structure

**Given** a handler returns a list of items
**When** `RespondJSON()` is called
**Then** the response is `{data: [...items], meta: {...}}`
**And** NOT `{data: {items: [...items]}, meta: {...}}`

**Given** frontend code expects `response.data.publishers`
**When** the API returns publishers
**Then** the data is at `response.publishers` (after useApi unwrapping)
**And** NOT at `response.data.publishers`

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.11 (frontend must use useApi which handles unwrapping)

**Technical Notes:**

**Files to Update (~80 instances):**
```bash
# Run to find double-wrapped responses:
grep -r "RespondJSON.*map\[string\]interface{}" api/internal/handlers --include="*.go"
```

**Migration Pattern:**
```go
// BEFORE (double-wrapped):
RespondJSON(w, r, http.StatusOK, map[string]interface{}{
    "publishers": publishers,
    "total":      len(publishers),
})

// AFTER (correct):
type PublishersResponse struct {
    Publishers []Publisher `json:"publishers"`
    Total      int         `json:"total"`
}
RespondJSON(w, r, http.StatusOK, PublishersResponse{
    Publishers: publishers,
    Total:      len(publishers),
})

// Or for simple cases:
RespondJSON(w, r, http.StatusOK, publishers)
```

**Response Structure After Fix:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "publishers": [...],
    "total": 10
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-12-02T10:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

**Frontend After useApi Unwrapping:**
```typescript
const result = await api.get('/publishers');
// result = { publishers: [...], total: 10 }
// NOT: result = { data: { publishers: [...] } }
```

**Validation:**
- Run frontend and verify no `data.data` access patterns needed
- Check network tab for consistent response structures

**Story Points:** 3

**FRs:** FR115 (Technical debt reduction - API consistency)

### Story 5.16: CI/CD Quality Gates and Pre-commit Hooks

**As a** developer,
**I want** automated enforcement of coding standards,
**So that** violations are caught before they enter the codebase.

**Standards Reference:** See `docs/coding-standards.md` sections:
- "Enforcement Mechanisms"
- "Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)"
- "CI Linting (Required for PRs)"

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Without enforcement, standards drift over time
- **Current State:** No pre-commit hooks, no CI standards check
- **Impact:** Technical debt accumulates silently

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** no pre-commit hooks exist for standards enforcement
**When** Story 5.16 is complete
**Then** husky pre-commit hooks block commits with violations

**Given** a developer commits code with raw `fetch()` calls
**When** the pre-commit hook runs
**Then** the commit is blocked with a clear error message
**And** the developer is directed to use `useApi()` instead

**Given** a PR is opened with coding standard violations
**When** CI runs
**Then** the standards check step fails
**And** the PR cannot be merged until violations are fixed

**Prerequisites:** Stories 5.11-5.15 (existing violations must be fixed first)

**Technical Notes:**

**Pre-commit Hook Setup:**
```bash
# Install husky
cd web && npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky init

# Create pre-commit hook
cat > .husky/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh

echo "🔍 Checking coding standards..."

# Block raw fetch in components
if grep -rq "await fetch(" web/app web/components --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Raw fetch() found in components."
  echo "   Use useApi() hook instead. See docs/coding-standards.md"
  exit 1
fi

# Block log.Printf in handlers (allow cmd/)
if grep -rEq "log\.Printf|fmt\.Printf" api/internal/handlers api/internal/services --include="*.go" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: log.Printf found in handlers/services."
  echo "   Use slog instead. See docs/coding-standards.md"
  exit 1
fi

# Block waitForTimeout in tests
if grep -rq "waitForTimeout" tests/e2e --include="*.ts" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: waitForTimeout found in tests."
  echo "   Use deterministic waits. See docs/coding-standards.md"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Coding standards check passed"
EOF
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

**CI GitHub Action Step:**
```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Coding Standards Check
  run: |
    echo "🔍 Checking coding standards..."

    FETCH_COUNT=$(grep -r "await fetch(" web/app web/components --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
    if [ "$FETCH_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "::error::Found $FETCH_COUNT raw fetch() calls. Use useApi() hook."
      exit 1
    fi

    LOG_COUNT=$(grep -rE "log\.Printf|fmt\.Printf" api/internal/handlers api/internal/services --include="*.go" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
    if [ "$LOG_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "::error::Found $LOG_COUNT log.Printf calls. Use slog instead."
      exit 1
    fi

    WAIT_COUNT=$(grep -r "waitForTimeout" tests/e2e --include="*.ts" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
    if [ "$WAIT_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "::error::Found $WAIT_COUNT waitForTimeout calls. Use deterministic waits."
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "✅ All standards checks passed"
```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Test pre-commit hook
echo "await fetch(" > test.tsx
git add test.tsx
git commit -m "test"  # Should fail
rm test.tsx

# Test CI locally
act -j lint  # If using act for local CI testing
```

### Story 5.17: Publisher Schema Refactor - Remove Organization, Mandatory Logo with AI Generation

**As a** platform user,
**I want** publisher profiles to be simplified (publisher IS the organization) with mandatory logos that can be AI-generated,
**So that** the data model is cleaner and all publishers have professional visual identity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the publishers table has an organization column
**When** Story 5.17 is complete
**Then** the organization column is removed from publishers and publisher_requests tables

**Given** a publisher is creating or editing their profile
**When** they submit the form without a logo
**Then** validation fails and they must provide a logo

**Given** a publisher doesn't have a logo image
**When** they click "Generate Logo"
**Then** a professional logo is generated from their publisher name initials
**And** they can customize the background color

**Given** frontend forms show organization field
**When** Story 5.17 is complete
**Then** organization field is removed from all publisher forms and displays

**Prerequisites:** None (can run in parallel with other Epic 5 stories)

**Technical Notes:**
- Create migration `00000000000026_remove_organization_mandatory_logo.sql`
- Update all SQLc queries and regenerate
- Create `web/components/publisher/LogoGenerator.tsx` with canvas-based initials logo
- Update all publisher-related frontend pages and components
- Add backend validation for required logo_url

**FRs:** FR120

---

### Story 5.18: Publisher Zman Field Ownership - Description, Transliteration, Formula Diff/Revert

**As a** publisher,
**I want** my own editable copy of description, transliteration, and formula when I add a zman from the registry, with clear indication when my values differ from the source and easy one-click revert,
**So that** I can customize these fields for my community while maintaining visibility into registry changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a publisher adds a zman from the registry
**When** the zman is created
**Then** description, transliteration, and formula are copied as the publisher's own values
**And** the original registry values are tracked for comparison

**Given** a publisher edits their copy of these fields
**When** the value differs from the registry
**Then** an amber "Modified" indicator appears
**And** a revert button allows one-click restoration to registry value

**Given** a zman is linked to another publisher (`source_type = 'linked'`)
**When** the publisher views the zman
**Then** the edit button is disabled with tooltip "Linked zmanim cannot be edited"
**And** the edit page shows all fields as read-only (except toggles)

**Prerequisites:** 5.0 (Database Schema)

**Technical Notes:**
- Extend pattern from `BilingualInput` (already handles names)
- Add `transliteration` and `description` columns to `publisher_zmanim`
- Return `source_*` fields from SQLc queries
- Create `DescriptionInput` and `FormulaSourceIndicator` components
- Disable edit button in `ZmanCard` for linked zmanim

**FRs:** FR121, FR122

---

### Story 5.19: Zman Request Review Workflow - Unified Edit/Review with Tag Approval Pipeline

**As an** admin,
**I want** to review zman requests using the same form as "Add to Registry" with approve/reject buttons, process new tag requests before the zman can be approved, and automatically email publishers about outcomes,
**So that** I can efficiently review requests with full editing capability, ensure tag quality, and keep publishers informed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an admin opens a zman request for review
**When** the review dialog opens
**Then** the same form as "Add to Registry" is shown with the request data pre-filled
**And** Approve/Reject buttons replace the Save button

**Given** a zman request includes new tag requests
**When** the admin views the request
**Then** pending tag requests are shown above the form
**And** the Approve button is disabled until all tags are approved/rejected

**Given** an admin approves a tag request
**When** they click Approve on a tag
**Then** the tag is created in the registry
**And** the tag is automatically linked to the zman request

**Given** an admin approves a zman request
**When** approval completes
**Then** the zman is added to the master registry
**And** an approval email is sent to the publisher
**And** if auto_add_on_approval is true, the zman is added to the publisher's list

**Prerequisites:** 5.8 (Admin Review Page)

**Technical Notes:**
- Extract form from registry page into `ZmanRegistryForm` component
- Add mode prop: 'create' | 'edit' | 'review'
- New endpoints: `/admin/zman-requests/:id/tags/:tagId/approve|reject`
- Use existing email service or create transactional email helper

**FRs:** FR123, FR124, FR125

- Publishers can customize zman names, descriptions, transliterations, and formulas with registry sync
- Publishers see clear "Different from Registry" indicators with one-click sync buttons
- Publishers can request new zmanim with guided tag selection
- Admins can efficiently review and approve zman requests with full editing capability
- Tag requests are approved before zman requests (quality gate)
- Publishers receive email notifications on approval/rejection
- The platform becomes community-driven with publisher contributions
- All publishers have professional logos (mandatory with crop/zoom editor or initials generator)
- Publisher names are organization names, not personal names
- **Publisher = Organization** (organization field removed, cleaner data model)
- **All publishers have logos** (mandatory with AI initials generator)
- **Codebase follows established standards** (0 violations across all categories)
- **All API calls use unified useApi() hook** (consistent auth and response handling)
- **All logging uses structured slog** (searchable, contextual logs)
- **Test suite is deterministic** (no hard waits, all tests parallel-safe)
- **CI enforces standards** (pre-commit hooks and pipeline checks block violations)

**Standards Reference:**
All technical debt stories reference `docs/coding-standards.md` for:
- Specific violation patterns and migration examples
- Validation commands to verify compliance
- Exemptions (api/cmd/ for logging, sqlcgen/ for generated code)
