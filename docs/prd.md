## Executive Summary

Zmanim Lab is a multi-publisher platform that empowers halachic (Jewish legal) authorities to publish customized prayer times (zmanim) with complete control over calculation algorithms and geographic coverage. The platform transforms a proof-of-concept into a fully functional, tested application that serves both publishers (rabbinic authorities) and end users (community members seeking accurate zmanim).

The core mission is democratizing zmanim publishing: any qualified halachic authority should be able to publish their calculation methods without needing technical expertise, while end users gain transparency into exactly how their prayer times are calculated.

### What Makes This Special

**Two-sided transparency that doesn't exist elsewhere:**

1. **For Publishers (Halachic Authorities):** The friendliest interface to configure zmanim algorithms. No JSON editing, no coding - just intuitive controls with sensible defaults. A rabbi can define their preferred calculation methods through a visual UI and immediately see the results.

2. **For End Users:** Complete transparency into the halachic reasoning. When viewing zmanim times, users can reveal the exact formula behind each time - seeing the solar angle, minute offset, or proportional hour method used. This creates accountability and education, connecting users to the halachic sources their times are based on.

**This is not just another zmanim app** - it's a publishing platform that brings authority-specific accuracy and halachic transparency to communities worldwide.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** SaaS B2B Platform (Multi-tenant with publisher management)
**Domain:** Religious/Community Technology
**Complexity:** Low (no regulatory requirements)

This is a brownfield project transforming an existing POC into a production-ready MVP. The technical foundation exists (Go backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL database with PostGIS) but requires:
- End-to-end functionality completion
- Clerk authentication integration
- Comprehensive testing
- Publisher-friendly algorithm configuration UI
- Production deployment verification

**Project Context:**
- Existing codebase with documented architecture
- Backend deployed to Fly.io, frontend targeting Vercel
- Database schema designed but application never fully operational
- Authentication planned (Clerk) but not integrated

---

## Success Criteria

Success for Zmanim Lab MVP is defined by these concrete outcomes:

**Publisher Success:**
- A halachic authority can configure their complete zmanim algorithm through the UI without any technical assistance
- Publishers can define geographic coverage areas and see them visualized on a map
- Publishers can preview their calculated times before going live
- At least 3 publishers actively using the platform with live zmanim

**End User Success:**
- Users can find relevant publishers for any location with Jewish communities
- Zmanim calculations load in under 2 seconds
- Users can reveal and understand the formula behind each time
- Zero calculation errors reported (times match expected values)

**Technical Success:**
- End-to-end authentication flow works with Clerk
- All API endpoints function correctly with proper error handling
- Test coverage exceeds 80% for critical calculation paths
- Production deployment stable on Fly.io + Vercel

**The "It Works" Moment:**
A rabbi in Brooklyn can log into the admin portal, configure their preferred Alos calculation (16.1 degrees), set their coverage area to the NYC metro region, and within minutes their community members can look up zmanim and see exactly which method their rabbi uses.

## User Experience Principles

### Design Philosophy

**"Invisible Complexity"** - The sophisticated astronomical calculations and halachic logic happen behind the scenes. Users interact with simple, intuitive controls that feel effortless.

**Visual Personality:**
- Clean, modern interface inspired by Apple's design language
- High contrast for outdoor readability (checking times on the go)
- Respectful, understated aesthetic appropriate for religious content
- Clear typography optimized for time display

**Core UX Principles:**

1. **Location First** - Everything starts with where you are. Location selection is prominent and fast.

2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show times simply, reveal complexity on demand. Formula details are one tap away but don't clutter the default view.

3. **Trust Through Transparency** - Every time shown can be traced back to its calculation method. This builds user confidence and honors halachic accountability.

4. **Publisher Identity** - Publishers are not anonymous data sources. Their name, organization, and credentials are clearly displayed, connecting users to trusted authorities.

5. **Instant Feedback** - For publishers configuring algorithms, show real-time preview of calculated times as they adjust parameters.

### Key Interactions

**End User Flow:**
```
Select Location → See Available Publishers → Choose Publisher → View Zmanim
                                                                    ↓

                                                         Reveal Formula
```

**Publisher Configuration Flow:**
```

  - Specific parameters (e.g., "16.1 degrees below horizon")
  - Brief halachic context (e.g., "Based on Shulchan Aruch...")
  - Link to publisher's full methodology documentation (if provided)
